    People need love, stop charging so much for it. 

I captured hip hop artist Dally Auston in Humboldt Park, Chicago circa 2016. Hanging in my art studio, we decided to snap photos in a nearby alleyway. His mixtape titled Roses and his song, 99¢ released at the time inspired the elements in this artifact. 

I also homaged Tupacs poem The Rose that Grew from Concrete.

This is is composed of photography, Illustration, and animation.
